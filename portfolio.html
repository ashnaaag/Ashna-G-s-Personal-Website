  <p id= "camp1"> Leadership camp ☆ <br>Over the summer, I got the chance to experience Leadership camp for myself.</br> Suffice to say, I learned alot about myself,<br>made so many friends, and learnt so many valuable lessons from it.</br> I'm hoping that these experiences and people who had such a huge<br> impact on me with carry into my passion and goal that I am trying to achieve.<br>Super special thanks to Katie and Bianca,<br> my two amazing counselors who pushed me to reflect <br>and become the best person I could be, all while encouraging me to be myself</br> (and of course some of my favorite people of all time, the purple torches).</p>
<img id = "camp" src= "assets/camp.JPG" alt= 'a picture of a group of people wearing purple outfits. some with bandanas, sunglasses, purple t shirts, and all of them with purple lanyards.'>


<img id = "roboarm" src= "assets/roboarm.jpg" alt= 'a picture of a robotic arm, built with gears and steel rods and platforms. motors are attached to it in order to enable its movements.'>
<img id = "step1" src= "assets/step1.jpg" alt= 'a picture of the robotic arm grabbing a pingpong ball from a persons hand' >
<img id = "step2" src= "assets/step2.jpg" alt= 'the robotic arm changes its position by 90 degrees, positioning itself above an orange bucket.' >
<img id = "step3" src= "assets/step3.jpg" alt= 'the robotic arm then lets go of the ball, letting it fall into the bucket.'>

<p id="roboarm1">  <br>Robotic Arm ☆ </br>In the images above, you're looking at a robotic arm <br>that a partner and I built. You can see my partner giving the arm a pingpong ball,</br> the arm then turns and drops the ball into the bucket.Though it seems rather simple,<br>we ran into so many problems and obstacles throughout building and programming the arm,</br> but we kept pushing through it, and eventually we made it work!<br> (I would've provided a video, but unfortunately ran into some technical difficulties...).</p>

<img id = "plaque" src= "assets/plaque.jpg" alt= 'image of a wooden plaque, on it reads "Michigan Industrial and Technology Education Society FIRST PLACE"'>
<img id = "tower" src= "assets/tower.JPG" alt= 'a tower made of wood, with three triangular frames, and 3 sticks. These stick are inserted in the notches of the triangular frames. this tower has a pyramid look to it.'> 

<p id="tower1"> Balsa Wood Tower Competition ☆ <br> In the images showcased above, you'll see a plaque and a wooden tower. This was for a competition wherein the requirements were </br>to create the lightest tower possible out of balsa wood that could hold the most weight.<br> My tower managed to win first place among the freshman/sophomore competitors! <br> the process of designing my tower required alot of trial and error,<br>but I kept pushing on and asked for advice from peers, teachers, and my dad (thanks dad). </p>
